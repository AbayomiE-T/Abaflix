# Abaflix

This project was done for a coding challenge for 'Black Professionals In Tech'. It uses Javascript, React and CSS in the front end with Redux for state management. Movie data is used from the Movie Database API to display list of currently popular movies. You have the ability to click on a movie and read it's overview and add the movie to your favourites. The UI is a netflix-inspired UI.
